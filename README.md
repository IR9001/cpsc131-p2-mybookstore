# cpsc131-p2-mybookstore

This project was developed by Matthew Merrick and Irvin Rafael.
In this project we had to make use of a doubly linked list to create a bookstore. We had to iterate through the linked list both forwards and backwards. We had to simulate how to access a book and check if it exists in the list.
